3. I want to work in IT,because it's interesting and the future lies behind it. Among my friends and acquaintances there are a lot of those who work in IT, but for many it's fashion, prestige, high income. For me, this area means much more. The ability to learn the unknown, to try the impossible, to be creative, to reveal your abilities and to improve yourself. Trying your hand at it now isn't even a dream, but the goal of my life. 

4. Skills: basic knowledge of html, css, python, c #.
5. 

```python
x = "Hello, world!"
print x
```
